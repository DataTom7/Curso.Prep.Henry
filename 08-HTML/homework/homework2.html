<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I "started up" in finance, education, digital marketing, business ... until I discovered that I loved innovation.</p>

<p>Some time ago I dedicate myself to be an entrepreneur in all its variants. That motivated me to create Ideas Factory, an ecosystem of solutions to help entrepreneurs turn ideas into opportunities.</p>

<p>In that methodological framework, we created Innovation Factory. a consultancy firm specialized in the design of innovation management systems for large companies.</p>

<p>My current challenge is leading Ruedas, a fintech startup that aims to become a dynamic, simple and transparent investment opportunity for those who want to invest in mobility opportunities.</p>

<p>What could I achieve during these years?</p>

<ul>

<li>A lot of experience working with large companies, optimizing procedures and implementing methodologies to reach the maximum level of quality.</li>

<li>Marked innovative trend, added to an excellent management of interpersonal relationships and coordination of interdisciplinary teams.</li>

<li>Vision and ability to implement new strategies, ability to work under pressure and a great adaptation to different scenarios.</li>

<li>What are my plans for the future? I will continue my work with companies, governments and non-profit organizations whose efforts are strongly focused on innovation as an essential component of their business. </li>

<h3>Expectations</h3>

<p>I would be really happy if I could a start a career in software development as it has been my dream for a long time. I feel I have been part of the tech world but the optics are different. I have always had a business involvement with the industry but I lack the most important thing... the ability to support my business experience with a  technical background. I really hope that I can commit to Henry's career to achieve one of the most important turnovers in my work life.</p>
